good ol scope creep. i present to kala asi and jan lakuse entirely remastered spoken audio collections.

i recommend the older version gets replaced with this everywhere.

reported missing files
fixed as many missing and incorrect phonemes as i could
removed as many clicks, pops, lip smacks, dropouts, and other issues as i could
standardized volume with dynamic range compression and normalization. -18LUFS
equalized tonal balance
reduced background noise
reduced room echo
standardized onset time
standardized file format; 1 channel 44.1kHz 192kbps CBR mp3 for speech, 2 channel 44.1kHz 192kbps CBR mp3 for sfx
removed 5_1 and 22_1 which were duplicates of 5_2 and 22_2, fixed filenames
shortened and quieted sfx, modified done.mp3 to make it more distinguishable

re wasona, the file lengths are such that the words should feel snappy to the touch with the word bubbles (it's not instant, there is padding; it's a bad idea not to have 50-100ms of room at the beginning), and the sentences are timed nicely when they're played immediately after the sfx, in case that's how you choose to implement it.

played back-to-back, each collection of files has its own tempo or cadence which should help it to be broadly useful.

what i've provided here is totally functional in its own right, but check the re-recording wishlist. that's actually a misnomer, some files are missing completely. at any rate send me more recordings and i'll process them the same way and finish off this updated collection. -jan kepijona
