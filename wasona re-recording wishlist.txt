jan Lakuse re-recording wishlist

some files are just missing outright

some files are mispronounced. no huge mistakes but somewhat likely to be misleading. a couple of them i was able to partially fix but in general there's nothing i can do in post. most problems are subtle, like 4_2 can sound like "piki ike". also there might be stuff i didn't catch because i'm not a linguist and i'm presumably biased towards a general american accent, but i did my best and i was pretty strict.

some files sound kinda cruddy. jan Lakuse's recording setup has a strange and frequent problem with dropouts. i was able to fully repair some of the damaged audio and partially repair the rest. the partially repaired audio ought to be re-recorded, ideally, but it's not a huge impediment to understanding i think, just a potential distraction.

error categories are most to least severe

missing:
Kenta, Nina, Palata, Elopa
27_2 There is yellow dust on the bee. ko jelo li lon pipi.

i also recommend you re-do the vowel ipa recordings, this time with a changing pitch over time rather than a steady pitch. my brain was having a little friction inside picking out which vowel it was and i think it's because it's hard to figure out the formant from a steady signal - if the pitch varied significantly, then the spectral content of the voice box is separated from the formant and each can be picked out. just a guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
